# Rust-Snake
A Rust implementation of snake using Raylib.
Has a few algorithms to play snake.

## A*
First there's A*, which is probably the most used pathfinding algorithm. I used it here quite simply to find the shortest path to the food without hitting my own tail.<br>
If there is no direct path, the snake will move in a random direction with a free space.
